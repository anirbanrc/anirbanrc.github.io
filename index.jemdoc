== About me

I did my PhD in the CSE department at Ohio State University (OSU), working on machine learning under the supervision of\n
[http://cse.osu.edu/~srini Prof. Srinivasan Parthasarathy] at OSU and [http://people.bu.edu/bkulis Prof. Brian Kulis] at Boston University. I received my M.S. (by PhD candidacy)\n
in December 2016 from OSU, and my bachelors in engineering from [http://www.jaduniv.edu.in Jadavpur University], India in 2010. I enjoyed awesome internships at\n
[http://research.google.com Google] (summer 2016) and [http://research.adobe.com Adobe Research] (summer 2015). Prior to starting my PhD, I spent a couple of years in industry working as a\n
software developer at [http://www.adobe.com Adobe Systems] in Noida, India from 2010 to 2012.
