\n\nA primary hobby of mine is photography; I especially enjoy the technical aspects, for which [http://www.dpreview.com DPreview] is my reference of choice.\n See some of my recent travel photos on my [https://www.flickr.com/photos/anirbanrc/ Flickr] page.

My gear consists of a Nikon D5000 camera, along with Tokina 12-28 F\/4 (my primary landscape lens), Nikkor 50mm F\/1.8, 18-105 F\/3.5-5.6 and 18-55 lenses.
