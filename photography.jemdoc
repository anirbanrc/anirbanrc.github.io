\n\nA primary hobby of mine is photography; I especially enjoy the technical aspects, for which [http://www.dpreview.com DPreview] is my reference of choice.\n See some of my recent travel photos on my [https://www.flickr.com/photos/anirbanrc/ Flickr] page.

My gear consists of Fujifilm X-T20 and Nikon D5000 cameras, along with Fujinon 18-55 F\/2.8-4.0, Tokina 12-28 F\/4 (my primary landscape lens), Nikkor 50mm F\/1.8, 18-105 and 18-55 F\/3.5-5.6, and the Nikon 70-210 F\/4 Series E lenses.
