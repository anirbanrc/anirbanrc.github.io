== Internships

- Data Scientist Intern, Adobe Research (San Jose, CA, USA),    May 2015 to August 2015.\n As an intern in the [https://research.adobe.com/about-the-labs/bigdata-experience-lab/ Big Data Experience] and Imagination Labs, I used deep learning techniques along  with multitask learning and stochastic subsampling for classification of highly imbalanced data. I implemented some custom mods to [http://caffe.berkeleyvision.org/ Caffe] for the neural net workflow, and used it in conjunction with some Python wrappers.\nMy mentors were [https://sites.google.com/site/buihhung/ Hung Bui] and [https://sites.google.com/site/trungbuistanford/ Trung Bui], and I also worked with [https://research.adobe.com/person/hailin-jin/ Hailin Jin].

- Software Engineering Intern, Google (Kirkland, WA, USA),   May 2016 to August 2016.\n As an intern in the Ads team, I wrote multi-head deep neural nets along with data extraction and post-processing pipelines for classification of large scale data. The pipeline stages were written in C\+\+, and I used Tensorflow with certain wrapper libraries (TF-Learn, TF-Serving) for the deep learning workflow.\n My mentor was Li He, and I also worked with [http://www.ics.uci.edu/~asuncion/ Arthur Asuncion], Alex Chen, and Zakaria Haque.

- Research Intern, IBM T. J. Watson Research Center (Yorktown Heights, NY, USA),    May 2017 to August 2017.\n I am working on a deep reinforcement learning project at the Center for Computational and Statistical Learning in the Mathematical Sciences division.\n My manager is Dr. Naoki Abe.
